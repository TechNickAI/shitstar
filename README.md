## Coding Principles

Borrowed from the [zen of python](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonPhilosophy), with a couple of changes.

```text
1. **Readability is the number 1 code quality metric**.
2. Beautiful is better than ugly.
3. Explicit is better than implicit.
4. Simple is better than complex.
5. Complex is better than complicated.
6. Flat is better than nested.
7. Sparse is better than dense.
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    * Although practicality beats purity.
9. Errors should never pass silently.
    * Unless explicitly silenced.
10. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
11. There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
12. Now is better than never.
```
